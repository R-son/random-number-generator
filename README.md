# Random number generator

This is an exercise to show some of my PHP skills.

Here's what this project consists in:
- An input box to assign how many dice must be rolled
- A drop down list to choose which type of dice will be rolled (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)

The form looks like that

After the form is submitted, the page displays how many dice were rolled and their type
